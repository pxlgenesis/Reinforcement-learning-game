#Reinfocement learning based Flappy bird:

This is a flappy bird game wrapped around a gymnasium and stablebaseline3 to implement a reinforcement learning model and while learning how it all processes.

[0.1v]

Early stages of flappy bird. currently learing how to implement good coding practices and trying to understand under the hood working of a game engine. Hence, the purpose of this project.

[0.1.rev01]

Bird flaps and rotates but ive used very crude coding methods it would improve once the game setting if formalized and basic skeleton is finished.

[0.1.rev02]

-Bird flaps and rotates but now the delta time calculation and entire physics calculation is frame independent plus neater code. 
-Pipe assets for sky and ground.
-Pipes MOVE yooo

[0.1.rev03]

-Bird physics finalized.
-Endless Random pipe generation works.
-Game resetting works
-Improved coding practices to make a more modular yet independent system for future integration with gymnasium.
-I CAN PAUSE THE GAME
