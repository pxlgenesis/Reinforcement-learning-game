REINFORCEMENT LEARNING IN FLAPPY BIRD :

About the project:

This project is basically learning how reinforcement learning can be applied to simple games like flappy bird.
Since the entire project is made previously with pygame, I took a simpler approach of using value-based reinforcement 
learning instead of using the more resource consuming vision based RL.

Libraries to install:
